- It supports the Japanese language and keyboard layout, as well as other languages and regional settings.
- It includes Service Pack 3, which is the latest and final service pack for Windows XP. It contains all the previous security updates and bug fixes for Windows XP, as well as some new features and enhancements, such as Network Access Protection, Microsoft Kernel Mode Cryptographic Module, and Black Hole Router Detection.
- It has a simple and user-friendly interface that allows you to access your files, programs, settings, and internet easily. It also has a built-in firewall, automatic updates, system restore, and Windows Media Player for playing music and videos.
- It supports various hardware devices and drivers, such as printers, scanners, cameras, sound cards, network adapters, and USB devices. It also supports wireless networking, Bluetooth, infrared, and multiple monitors.
- It has some features that are not available in Windows XP Professional, such as Fast User Switching, which allows you to switch between different user accounts without logging off; Windows Movie Maker, which allows you to create and edit videos; and Windows Messenger, which allows you to chat and communicate with other users.

However, Windows XP Home Edition SP3 (Japanese) also has some limitations and disadvantages compared to Windows XP Professional. For example:

- It cannot join a Windows Server domain, which is a group of computers that are remotely managed by one or more central servers. This means that it cannot use some of the centralized administration features, such as Group Policies, Automatic Software Installation and Maintenance, Roaming User Profiles, and Remote Installation Services.
- It does not have an access control scheme that allows specific permissions on files to be granted to specific users. This means that anyone who has access to your computer can view or modify your files unless you encrypt them using the Encrypting File System.
- It does not have a Remote Desktop server, which allows a PC to be operated by another Windows XP user over a local area network or the Internet. This means that you cannot remotely access your computer from another location or allow someone else to remotely control your computer.
- It does not support two physical central processing units (CPUs), which are the main components of a computer that perform calculations and instructions. This means that it cannot take advantage of the increased performance and multitasking capabilities of dual-core or multi-core CPUs.
- It does not have some advanced tools and utilities, such as Internet Information Services (IIS), Microsoft's HTTP and FTP Server; Windows Management Instrumentation Console (WMIC), a command-line tool for retrieving information about a system; and the ability to switch hard disk storage type from Basic to Dynamic and vice versa.

Therefore, Windows XP Home Edition SP3 (Japanese) is suitable for home users who want a simple and reliable operating system in Japanese. However, it may not meet the needs of business and power users who require more advanced features and functionality.
