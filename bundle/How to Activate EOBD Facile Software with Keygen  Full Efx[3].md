# How to Activate EOBD Facile Software with Keygen
 
EOBD Facile is a popular diagnostic software that allows you to access the data from your car's engine and other systems. It works with ELM327-based OBD2 scanners and supports various protocols and features. However, to unlock the full potential of EOBD Facile, you need to activate it with a license key.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use a keygen to generate a valid license key for EOBD Facile software. A keygen is a program that creates random serial numbers that can be used to activate software products. However, using a keygen may be illegal or risky, so we do not recommend it. Instead, we suggest you buy a genuine license from the official website of EOBD Facile.
