G-Wizard CNC Calculator is a useful tool for CNC machinists who want to improve their productivity, efficiency and quality of their work. It can help them save time, money and materials by finding the optimal cutting parameters for their CNC machines. G-Wizard CNC Calculator is also easy to use and learn, with a user-friendly interface and online support.

One of the main features of G-Wizard CNC Calculator is its ability to handle different types of tooling, such as end mills, drills, taps, reamers, face mills, fly cutters, dovetail cutters and more. The software can also handle special router cutters, such as V-bits, engraving cutters and compression cutters. The user can select the tool type from a drop-down menu, and enter the tool dimensions, such as diameter, length, number of flutes and helix angle. The software will then calculate the best feeds and speeds for the selected tool and material.
 
Another feature of G-Wizard CNC Calculator is its ability to use manufacturer's recommended data for various tools and materials. The software has a database of over 2000 tools and 500 materials from different brands and suppliers. The user can choose the tool and material from the database, or enter their own custom data. The software will then use the manufacturer's data to calculate the optimal feeds and speeds for the selected tool and material. This feature can help the user avoid trial and error and use the best practices for their CNC machines.
