# Human Body Parts and Functions in Tamil
 
The human body is a complex and amazing biological machine. It consists of many different parts and systems that work together to perform various functions. In this article, we will learn about some of the major parts and systems of the human body and their functions in Tamil.
 
## Skeletal System
 
The skeletal system is made up of 206 bones that provide support, movement, protection, blood cell production, calcium storage and endocrine regulation[^4^]. The skeletal system is divided into two parts: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton includes the skull, the vertebral column, the rib cage and the sternum. The appendicular skeleton includes the pectoral girdle, the upper limbs, the pelvic girdle and the lower limbs.

## Vital Organs
 
The vital organs are essential for survival and include the brain, the heart, the lungs, the liver and the kidneys. The brain is the control center of the body that communicates with other organs via hormones and nerves. The heart pumps blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients and removing waste. The lungs extract oxygen from the air and send it to the blood. The liver detoxifies chemicals, breaks down drugs, filters blood, secretes bile and produces clotting proteins. The kidneys eliminate waste and excess fluid from the body and make urine.
 
In Tamil, some of the common terms for the vital organs are:

- Brain - à®®à¯à®³à¯ (mÅ«á¸·ai)
- Heart - à®à®¤à®¯à®®à¯ (itayam)

## Reproductive System
 
The reproductive system allows humans to reproduce and bear children. The male reproductive system includes the penis and the testes, which produce sperm. The female reproductive system includes the vagina, the uterus and the ovaries, which produce eggs. During conception, a sperm cell merges with an egg cell, creating a fertilized egg that implants and grows in the uterus.

## Integumentary System
 
The integumentary system is also known as the skin, but it also includes the hair and nails. This is the body's largest organ, covering about 1.5 to 2 square meters of surface area. The skin protects the body from external factors such as pathogens, chemicals, sunlight and temperature changes. The skin also helps to regulate body temperature and eliminate waste via perspiration. The skin consists of three layers: the epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer that contains keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells and Merkel cells. The dermis is the middle layer that contains blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands. The hypodermis is the innermost layer that contains adipose tissue and connective tissue.
 
In Tamil, some of the common terms for the integumentary system are:

- Skin - à®¤à¯à®²à¯ (tÅl)
- Hair - à®®à¯à®à®¿ (muá¹­i)
- Nail - à®¨à®à®®à¯ (nakam)

## Muscular System
 
The muscular system contains about 650 muscles that enable movement, posture, circulation and digestion. The muscles are composed of bundles of muscle fibers that contract and relax in response to nerve signals. The muscles are classified into three types: skeletal, smooth and cardiac. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tendons and are responsible for voluntary movements such as walking, talking and lifting. Smooth muscles are found in the walls of internal organs such as the stomach, intestines and blood vessels and are responsible for involuntary movements such as peristalsis and vasoconstriction. Cardiac muscles are found in the heart and are responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.
 
In Tamil, some of the common terms for the muscular system are:

- Muscle - à®¤à®à¯ (tacai)
- Skeletal muscle - à®à®²à¯à®®à¯à®ªà¯ à®¤à®à¯ (elumpu tacai)
- Smooth muscle - à®®à¯à®©à¯à®®à¯à®¯à®¾à®© à®¤à®à¯ (meá¹mai'yÄá¹a tacai)
- Cardiac muscle - à®à®¤à®¯ à®¤à®à¯ (itaya tacai)
- Tendon - à®¨à®°à¯ (narai)
